## Description
The purpose of this project was to create an application, using React, which has several pages including an About Me, Portfolio, Resume, and Contact Me page. This application can be used as a pitch to future possible employers who would like to get a glimpse of the skills you've learned while taking any coding courses.

 ## Installation
First, you have to make sure that you have vite installed. To do so, type "npm create vite@4.4.1" in your terminal. Once vite is installed, name your project, select React as your framework, and choose Typescript as the coding language. Once that step is done, enter "cd -name of your project-", followed by "npm i" or "npm install" to install all the necessary packages. After all of the packages have been installed, run the program by typing "npm run dev". Afterwards, the application will build and a link to your local host should pop up. Click on the link and the application will be loaded on your local host in your browser.

 ## Usage
The usage of this project is to have an online resume application to showcase your coding skills to employers who may want to hire you. To view this application, please visit: https://tourmaline-tarsier-951f4c.netlify.app/
